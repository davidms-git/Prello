##  Project Overview

We developed a data-driven City Prioritisation Dashboard to support Prello‚Äôs expansion strategy into the French second-home market. By integrating real estate, socio-economic, and tourism KPIs, we ranked 300+ municipalities and built a scoring model tailored to different investor personas.  

**David de la Mora** led the project coordination, KPI selection, clustering model development, and Looker dashboard planning.

---

##  Objectives

- Rank municipalities using a custom **City Opportunity Score**
- Support city recommendations for **three investor personas**
- Build interactive dashboards for business users
- Use **KMeans Clustering** to segment cities by investment potential

---

##  Data Exploration & EDA

- Conducted descriptive stats in Google Colab on a joined BigQuery export  
- Audited nulls, outliers, and distributions  
- Visualized histograms and KPI correlations  
- Sample size: 30.000+ municipalities  
- Guided data cleaning and normalization strategy

##  KPIs Used

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `rental_yield` | ROI proxy from median rent / price per m¬≤ |
| `establishment_score` | Weighted count of tourism-related businesses |
| `poi_density` | POI count normalized by population |
| `housing_stress_index` | Indicates local housing demand tension |
| `second_home_ratio` | % of second homes in housing stock |
| `vacancy_rate` | % of empty housing units |
| `population_growth` | 5-year growth from INSEE |
| `sales_price_m2` | Median real estate price |
| `avg_net_salary` | Excluded from scoring (missingness) |

KPIs were **normalized**, cleaned, and analyzed for redundancy and correlation before modeling.

##  Clustering Model (Google Colab)

- Used `StandardScaler` + `KMeans` (n=4)  
- Elbow method used to determine optimal clusters  
- Segment labels:
  - üü£ Affluent Urban Growth
  - üîµ Tourist Zones, Past Peak
  - üü¢ Balanced Local Towns *(not considered in dashboard scoring due to limited second-home interest)*
  - üü† High-Yield, Declining Areas  
- Visualized clusters with Plotly and seaborn

---

##  Dashboard (Looker Studio)

- City heatmap with Opportunity Score  
- Persona-based recommendation filters  
- Interactive KPI comparisons  
- Exportable ranking tables  

---

##  Datasets Used (BigQuery)

- `real_estate_info_by_municipality`
- `housing_stock`
- `POI_tourist_establishments`
- `POI_touristic_sites_by_municipality`
- `Intensite_tension_immo`
- `Population_by_municipality`
- `average_salary_by_municipality`
